             DSCP and other packet markings for RTCWeb QoS
                   draft-dhesikan-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-00

Abstract

   Many networks, such as service provider and enterprise networks, can
   provide per packet treatments based on Differentiated Services Code
   Points (DSCP) on a per hop basis.  This document provides the
   recommended DSCP values for browsers to use for various classes of
   traffic.

1.  Introduction

   DiffServ style packet marking can help provide QoS in some
   environments.  There are many use cases where such marking does not
   help, but it seldom makes things worse if packets are marked
   appropriately.  In other words, when attempting to avoid congestion
   by marking certain traffic flows, say all audio or all audio and
   video, marking too many audio and/or video flows for a given
   network's capacity can prevent desirable results.  Either too much
   other traffic will be starved, or there is not enough capacity for
   the preferentially marked packets (i.e., audio and/or video).

   This draft proposes how a browser and other VoIP applications can
   mark packets.  This draft does not contradict or redefine any advice
   from previous IETF RFCs but simply provides a simple set of
   recommendations for implementors based on the previous RFCs.

   There are some environments where priority markings frequently help.
   These include:

   1.  If the congested link is the broadband uplink in a Cable or DSL
   scenario, often residential routers/NAT support preferential
   treatment based on DSCP.

   2.  If the congested link is a local WiFi network, marking may help.

   3.  In some cellular style deployments, markings may help in cases
   where the network does not remove them.

   Traditionally DSCP values have been thought of as being site
   specific, with each site selecting its own code points for each QoS
   level.  However in the RTCWeb use cases, the browsers need to set
   them to something when there is no site specific information.  This
   document describes a reasonable default set of DSCP code point values
   drawn from existing RFCs and common usage.  These code points are
   solely defaults.  Future drafts may define mechanisms for site
   specific mappings to override the values provided in this draft.

   This draft defines some inputs that the browser can look at to
   determine how to set the various packet markings and defines the a
   mapping from abstract QoS policies (media type, priority level) to
   those packet markings.

2.  Relation to Other Standards

   This specification does not change or override the advice in any
   other standards about setting packet markings.  It simply provides a
   non-normative summary of them and provides the context of how they
   relate into the RTCWeb context.  This document also specifies the
   requirements for the W3C WebRTC API to understand what it needs to
   control, and how the control splits between things the JavaScript
   application running in the browser can control and things the browser
   needs to control.  In some cases, such as DSCP where the normative
   RFC leaves open multiple options to choose from, this clarifies which
   choice should be used in the RTCWeb context.


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


4.  Inputs

   The first input is the type of the media.  The browser provides this
   input as it knows if the media is audio, video, or data.  In this
   specification, both interactive and streaming media is included.
   They are treated in different categories as their QoS requirements
   are slightly different.  The second input is the relative treatment
   of the stream within that session.  Many applications have multiple
   video streams and often some are more important than others.
   JavaScript applications can tell the browser whether a particular
   media stream is high, medium, or low importance to the application.


5.  DSCP Mappings

   Below is a table of DSCP markings for each media type RTCWeb is
   interested in.  These DSCPs for each media type listed are a
   reasonable default set of code point values, and currently not
   mandatory for every usage.

8.  W3C API Implications

   To work with this proposal, the W3C specification SHOULD provide a
   way to specify the importance of media and data streams.

   The W3C API SHOULD also provide a way for the application to find out
   the source and destination IP and ports of any flow as well as the
   DSCP value or other markings in use for that flow.  The JavaScript
   application can then communicate this to a web service that may
   install a particular policy for that flow.

   The W3C API SHOULD NOT provide a way for the JavaScript to
   arbitrarily set the marketing to any value of the JavaScript choosing
   as this reduces the security provided by the browser knowing the
   media type.

9.  Security Considerations

   TODO - discuss implications of what browser can set and what
   JavaScript can set


10.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require any actions from IANA.


11.  Acknowledgements

   Cullen Jennings was one of the authors of this text in the original
   individual submission but was unceremoniously kicked off by the
   chairs when it became a WG version.  Thanks for hints on code to do
   this from Paolo Severini, Jim Hasselbrook, Joe Marcus, and Erik
   Nordmark.


12.  Appendix: Code Hints

   On windows setting the source interface works but BSD, OSX, Linux use
   weak end-system model and will route out different interface if that
   looks like a better route.  (TODO - Can someone verify this with
   specific versions?)

   In windows you might be able to tell something about priority of an
   interface for ICE purposes with WlanQueryInterface or GetIfTable.

   The specific mechanisms required to set DSCP code points depend on
   the application platform.

   In windows, setting the DSCP is not easy.  See Knowledge Base Article
   KB248611.  TODO - add more information about what can be done for
   windows.

   For most unix variants, the following program can set DSCP.

   TODO - make this work in V6.  For v6 have a look at IPv6_TCLASS or
   better the tclass part of sin6_flowid for IPv6

   TODO - Can someone test and report back results of program in iOS,
   Android, Linux, OSX, BSD.

   Example test program:
