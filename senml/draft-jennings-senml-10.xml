      <t>This specification defines media types for representing simple sensor
      measurements and device parameters in the Sensor Markup Language
      (SenML). Representations are defined in JavaScript Object Notation
      (JSON), eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Efficient XML Interchange
      (EXI), which share the common SenML data model. A simple sensor, such as
      a temperature sensor, could use this media type in protocols such as
      HTTP or CoAP to transport the measurements of the sensor or to be
      configured.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>Connecting sensors to the internet is not new, and there have been
      many protocols designed to facilitate it. This specification defines new
      media types for carrying simple sensor information in a protocol such as
      HTTP or CoAP<xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"></xref> called the Sensor
      Markup Language (SenML). This format was designed so that processors
      with very limited capabilities could easily encode a sensor measurement
      into the media type, while at the same time a server parsing the data
      could relatively efficiently collect a large number of sensor
      measurements. There are many types of more complex measurements and
      measurements that this media type would not be suitable for. A decision
      was made not to carry most of the meta data about the sensor in this
      media type to help reduce the size of the data and improve efficiency in
      decoding. Instead meta-data about a sensor resource can be described
      out-of-band using the CoRE Link Format <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-core-link-format"></xref>. The markup language can be
      used for a variety of data flow models, most notably data feeds pushed
      from a sensor to a collector, and the web resource model where the
      sensor is requested as a resource representation (GET
      /sensor/temperature).</t>

      <t>SenML is defined by a data model for measurements and simple
      meta-data about measurements and devices. The data is structured as a
      single object (with attributes) that contains an array of entries. Each
      entry is an object that has attributes such as a unique identifier for
      the sensor, the time the measurement was made, and the current value.
      Serializations for this data model are defined for JSON <xref
      target="RFC4627"></xref>, XML and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) <xref
      target="W3C.REC-exi-20110310"></xref>.</t>

      <t>For example, the following shows a measurement from a temperature
      gauge encoded in the JSON syntax.</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[{"e":[{ "n": "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063", "v":23.5, "u":"Cel" }]}
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>In the example above, the array in the object has a single
      measurement for a sensor named "urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063" with a
      temperature of 23.5 degrees Celsius.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements and Design Goals">
      <t>The design goal is to be able to send simple sensor measurements in
      small packets on mesh networks from large numbers of constrained
      devices. Keeping the total size under 80 bytes makes this easy to use on
      a wireless mesh network. It is always difficult to define what small
      code is, but there is a desire to be able to implement this in roughly 1
      KB of flash on a 8 bit microprocessor. Experience with Google power
      meter and large scale deployments has indicated that the solution needs
      to support allowing multiple measurements to be batched into a single
      HTTP or CoAP request. This "batch" upload capability allows the server
      side to efficiently support a large number of devices. It also
      conveniently supports batch transfers from proxies and storage devices,
      even in situations where the sensor itself sends just a single data item
      at a time. The multiple measurements could be from multiple related
      sensors or from the same sensor but at different times.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="semant" title="Semantics">
      <t>Each representation caries a single SenML object that represents a
      set of measurements and/or parameters. This object contains several
      optional attributes described below and a mandatory array of one or more
      entries.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Base Name"><vspace blankLines="1" />This is a string
          that is prepended to the names found in the entries. This attribute
          is optional.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Base Time"><vspace blankLines="1" />A base time that is
          added to the time found in an entry. This attribute is
          optional.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Base Units"><vspace blankLines="1" />A base unit that
          is assumed for all entries, unless otherwise indicated. The base unit 
          SHOULD comply with the Unified Code for Units of Measure <xref target="UCUM"/>
          in case sensitive form (c/s column). This
          attribute is optional. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Version"><vspace blankLines="1" />Version number of
          media type format. This attribute is optional positive integer and
          defaults to 1 if not present.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Measurement or Parameter Entries"><vspace
          blankLines="1" />Array of values for sensor measurements or other
          generic parameters (such as configuration parameters). If present
          there must be at least one entry in the array.<vspace
          blankLines="1" /></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Each array entry contains several attributes, some of which are
      optional and some of which are mandatory.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Name"><vspace blankLines="1" />Name of the sensor or
          parameter. When appended to the Base Name attribute, this must
          result in a globally unique identifier for the resource. The name is
          optional, if the Base Name is present. If the name is missing Base
          Name must uniquely identify the resource. This can be used to
          represent a large array of measurements from the same sensor without
          having to repeat its identifier on every measurement.<vspace
          blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Units"><vspace blankLines="1" />Units for a measurement
          value. The unit SHOULD comply with the Unified Code for Units of
          Measure <xref target="UCUM"/> in case sensitive form (c/s column).
          Optional, if Base Unit is present or if not required for a
          parameter.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Value"><vspace blankLines="1" />Value of the entry.
          Optional if a Sum value is present, otherwise required. Values are
          represented using three basic data types, Floating point numbers
          ("v" field for "Value"), Booleans ("bv" for "Boolean Value") and
          Strings ("sv" for "String Value"). Exactly one of these three fields
          MUST appear.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Sum"><vspace blankLines="1" />Integrated sum of the
          values over time. Optional. This attribute is in the units specified
          in the Unit value multiplied by seconds.<vspace
          blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Time"><vspace blankLines="1" />Time when value was
          recorded. Optional.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Update Time"><vspace blankLines="1" />Update time. A
          time in seconds that represents the maximum time before this sensor
          will provide an updated reading for a measurement. This can be used
          to detect the failure of sensors or communications path from the
          sensor. Optional.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The SenML format can be extended with further custom attributes
      placed in the base object, or in an entry. Extensions in the base object
      pertain to all entries, whereas extensions in an entry object only
      pertain to that.</t>

      <t>Systems reading one of the objects MUST check for the Version
      attribute. If this value is a version number larger than the version
      which the system understands, the system SHOULD NOT use this object.
      This allows the version number to indicate that the object contains
      mandatory to understand attributes. New version numbers can only be
      defined in RFC which updates this specification or it successors.</t>

      <t>The Name value is concatenated to the Base Name value to get the name
      of the sensor. The resulting name needs to uniquely identify and
      differentiate the sensor from all others. If the object is a
      representation resulting from the request of a URI <xref
      target="RFC3986"></xref>, then in the absence of the Base Name
      attribute, this URI is used as the default value of Base Name. Thus in
      this case the Name field needs to be unique for that URI, for example an
      index or subresource name of sensors handled by the URI.</t>

      <t>Alternatively, for objects not related to a URI, a unique name is
      required. In any case, it is RECOMMENDED that the full names are
      represented as URIs or URNs <xref target="RFC2141"></xref>. One way to
      create a unique name is to include a EUI-48 or EUI-64 identifier (A MAC
      address) or some other bit string that is guaranteed uniqueness (such as
      a 1-wire address) that is assigned to the device. Some of the examples
      in this draft use the device URN type as specified in <xref
      target="I-D.arkko-core-dev-urn"></xref>. UUIDs <xref
      target="RFC4122"></xref> are another way to generate a unique name.</t>

      <t>The resulting concatenated name MUST consist only of characters out
      of the set "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", "0" to "9", "-", ":", ".", or "_" and
      it MUST start with a character out of the set "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", or
      "0" to "9". This restricted character set was chosen so that these names
      can be directly used as in other types of URI including segments of an
      HTTP path with no special encoding. <xref target="RFC5952"></xref>
      contains advice on encoding an IPv6 address in a name.</t>

      <t>If either the Base Time or Time value is missing, the missing
      attribute is considered to have a value of zero. The Base Time and Time
      values are added together to get the time of measurement. A time of zero
      indicates that the sensor does not know the absolute time and the
      measurement was made roughly "now". A negative value is used to indicate
      seconds in the past from roughly "now". A positive value is used to
      indicate the number of seconds, excluding leap seconds, since the start
      of the year 1970 in UTC .</t>

      <t>Representing the statistical characteristics of measurements can be
      very complex. Future specification may add new attributes to provide
      better information about the statistical properties of the
      measurement.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Associating Meta-data">
      <t>SenML is designed to carry the minimum dynamic information about
      measurements, and for efficiency reasons does not carry more static
      meta-data about the device, object or sensors. Instead, it is assumed
      that this meta-data is carried out of band. For web resources using
      SenML representations, this meta-data can be made available using the
      CoRE Link Format <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-link-format"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The CoRE Link Format provides a simple way to describe Web Links, and
      in particular allows a web server to describe resources it is hosting.
      The list of links that a web server has available, can be discovered by
      retrieving the /.well-known/core resource, which returns the list of
      links in the CoRE Link Format. Each link may contain attributes, for
      example title, resource type, interface description and
      content-type.</t>

      <t>The most obvious use of this link format is to describe that a
      resource is available in a SenML format in the first place. The relevant
      media type indicator is included in the Content-Type (ct=)
      attribute.</t>

      <t>Further semantics about a resource can be included in the Resource
      Type and Interface Description attributes. The Resource Type (rt=)
      attribute is meant to give a semantic meaning to that resource. For
      example rt="outdoor-temperature" would indicate static semantic meaning
      in addition to the unit information included in SenML. The Interface
      Description (if=) attribute is used to describe the REST interface of a
      resource, and may include e.g. a reference to a WADL description <xref
      target="WADL"></xref>.</t>

      "bu" attribute with a value of type string. The object MAY contain a
      "ver" attribute with a value of type number. The object MAY contain

      attributes are of type floating point. All the attributes are optional,
      but as specified in <xref target="semant"></xref>, one of the "v", "sv",

      floating point numbers that are representable as an IEEE
      double-precision floating-point numbers <xref

      measurement is not relevant, so a reading of 1.1 has exactly the same
      semantic meaning as 1.10. If the value has an exponent, the "e" MUST be
      in lower case. The mantissa SHOULD be less than 19 characters long and
      the exponent SHOULD be less than 5 characters long. This allows time
      values to have better than micro second precision over the next 100
      years.</t>

    <section title="EXI Representation (application/senml-exi)">
      <t>For efficient transmission of SenML over e.g. a constrained network,
      Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) can be used. This encodes the XML Schema
      structure of SenML into binary tags and values rather than ASCII text.
      An EXI representation of SenML SHOULD be made using the strict
      schema-mode of EXI. This mode however does not allow tag extensions to
      the schema, and therefore any extensions will be lost in the encoding.
      For uses where extensions need to be preserved in EXI, the non-strict
      schema mode of EXI MAY be used.</t>

      <t>The EXI header option MUST be included. An EXI schemaID options MUST
      be set to the value of "a" indicating the scheme provided in this
      specification. Future revisions to the schema can change this schemaID
      to allow for backwards compatibility. When the data will be transported
      over COAP or HTTP, an EXI Cookie SHOULD NOT be used as it simply makes
      things larger as is redundant to information provided in the
      Content-Type header.</t>

      <t>The following XSD Schema is generated from the RelaxNG and used for
      strict schema guided EXI processing.</t>

      Consider the example of a temperature sensor that produces a value in
      tenths of degrees Celsius over a range of 0.0 to 55.0. = It would
      produce XML SenML file such as:</t>

      <t>A small temperature sensor devices that only generates this one EXI
      file does not really need an full EXI implementation. It can simple hard
      code the output replacing the one wire device ID starting at byte 0x14
      and going to byte 0x23 with it's device ID , and replacing the value
      "0xe7 0x01" at location 0x33 to 0x34 with the current temperature. The
      EXI Specification<xref target="W3C.REC-exi-20110310"></xref> contains
      the full information on how floating point numbers are represented, but
      for the purpose of this sensor, the temperature can be converted to an
      integer in tenths of degrees ( 231 in this example ). EXI stores 7 bits
      of the integer in each byte with the top bit set to one if there are
      further bytes. So the first bytes at location 0x33 is set to low 7 bits
      of the integer temperature in tenths of degrees plus 0x80. In this
      example 231 &amp; 0x7F + 0x80 = 0xE7. The second byte at location 0x34
      is set to the integer temperature in tenths of degrees right shifted 7
      bits. In this example 231 &gt;&gt; 7 = 0x01.</t>

    <section title="Usage Considerations">
      <t>The measurements support sending both the current value of a sensor
      as well as the an integrated sum. For many types of measurements, the
      sum is more useful than the current value. For example, an electrical
      meter that measures the energy a given computer uses will typically want
      to measure the cumulative amount of energy used. This is less prone to
      error than reporting the power each second and trying to have something
      on the server side sum together all the power measurements. If the
      network between the sensor and the meter goes down over some period of
      time, when it comes back up, the cumulative sum helps reflect what
      happened while the network was down. A meter like this would typically
      report a measurement with the units set to watts, but it would put the
      sum of energy used in the "s" attribute of the measurement. It might
      optionally include the current power in the "v" attribute.</t>

      <t>While the benefit of using the integrated sum is fairly clear for
      measurements like power and energy, it is less obvious for something
      like temperature. Reporting the sum of the temperature makes it easy to
      compute averages even when the individual temperature values are not
      reported frequently enough to compute accurate averages. Implementors
      are encouraged to report the cumulative sum as well as the raw value of
      a given sensor.</t>

      <t>Applications that use the cumulative sum values need to understand
      they are very loosely defined by this specification, and depending on
      the particular sensor implementation may behave in unexpected ways.
      Applications should be able to deal with the following issues:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Many sensors will allow the cumulative sums to "wrap" back to
          zero after the value gets sufficiently large.</t>

          <t>Some sensors will reset the cumulative sum back to zero when the
          device is reset, loses power, or is replaced with a different
          sensor.</t>

          <t>Applications cannot make assumptions about when the device
          started accumulating values into the sum.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Typically applications can make some assumptions about specific
      sensors that will allow them to deal with these problems. A common
      assumption is that for sensors whose measurement values are always
      positive, the sum should never get smaller; so if the sum does get
      smaller, the application will know that one of the situations listed
      above has happened.</t>

          <t>Encoding considerations: Must be encoded as using a subset of the
          encoding allowed in <xref target="RFC4627"></xref>. Specifically,
          only the ASCII<xref target="RFC0020"></xref> subset of the UTF-8
          characters are allowed. This simplifies implementation of very
          simple system and does not impose any significant limitations as all
          this data is meant for machine to machine communications and is not
          meant to be human readable.</t>

          <t>Security considerations: Sensor data can contain a wide range of
          information ranging from information that is very public, such the
          outside temperature in a given city, to very private information
          that requires integrity and confidentiality protection, such as
          patient health information. This format does not provide any
          security and instead relies on the transport protocol that carries
          it to provide security. Given applications need to look at the
          overall context of how this media type will be used to decide if the
          security is adequate.</t>

          <t>Interoperability considerations: Applications should ignore any
          JSON key value pairs that they do not understand. This allows
          backwards compatibility extensions to this specification. The "ver"
          field can be used to ensure the receiver supports a minimal level of

          <abstract>
            <t>This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol
            (CoAP), a specialized web transfer protocol for use with
            constrained networks and nodes for machine-to-machine applications
            such as smart energy and building automation. These constrained
            nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM
            and RAM, while networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet
            error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. CoAP
            provides a method/response interaction model between application
            end-points, supports built-in resource discovery, and includes key
            web concepts such as URIs and content-types. CoAP easily
            translates to HTTP for integration with the web while meeting
            specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low
            overhead and simplicity for constrained environments.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>As IPv6 deployment increases, there will be a dramatic increase
            in the need to use IPv6 addresses in text. While the IPv6 address
            architecture in Section 2.2 of RFC 4291 describes a flexible model
            for text representation of an IPv6 address, this flexibility has
            been causing problems for operators, system engineers, and users.
            This document defines a canonical textual representation format.
            It does not define a format for internal storage, such as within
            an application or database. It is expected that the canonical
            format will be followed by humans and systems when representing
            IPv6 addresses as text, but all implementations must accept and be
            able to handle any legitimate RFC 4291 format. [STANDARDS

            <t>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace
            for UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs
            (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID is 128 bits long, and can
            guarantee uniqueness across space and time. UUIDs were originally
            used in the Apollo Network Computing System and later in the Open
            Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment
            (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows platforms.</t>

            <t>This specification is derived from the DCE specification with
