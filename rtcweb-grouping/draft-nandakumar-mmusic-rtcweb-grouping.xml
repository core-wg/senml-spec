			 In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media encodings

			 This is called Simulcast. This document discusses a framework for describing
			 simulcast media streams in SDP and also defines semantics to express 
			 relationship amongst them. The semantics defined in this document are to 
			 be used with the source specific grouping framework defined in 
			the <xref target="RFC5576"/>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>
        Simulcast refers to taking media from a single media capture (e.g., a camera), 
        and encoding it multiple times at different resolutions and / or frame rates.
        For example, a device with a single HD camera may send one version of the 
        video at full HD resolution, and a second version encoded at a low resolution. 
        This would allow a video conferencing bridge to be able to send the 
        high resolution copy to some destination and low resolution copy to 
        other destinations without having to recode the video at the 
        conference bridge.
      </t>
      <t>
       <xref target="I-D.westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast"/> describes 
       different encodings of a media content to be combination of the following:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t> Bit-rate:  The difference is the amount of bits spent to encode the
      media thus giving different quality. </t>
         <t> Codec: Different media codecs are used to ensure that different
      receivers that do not have a common set of decoders can decode at
      least one of the versions.  This can include codec configuration
      options that are not compatible, like video encoder profiles, or
      the capability of receiving the transport packetization. </t>
      <t>  Sampling:  Different sampling of media, in spatial as well as in
      temporal domain, may be used to suit different rendering
      capabilities or needs at the receiving endpoints, as well as a
      method to achieve different bit-rates.  For video streams, spatial
      sampling affects image resolution and temporal sampling affects
      video frame rate.  For audio, spatial sampling relates to the
      number of audio channels and temporal sampling affects audio
      bandwidth.  Obviously, a difference in sampling may result in
      difference in bit-rate. </t>

		In any application that needs to send multiple encodings, there is a 
		potential need for simulcast. The purpose of this document is to discuss 
		suitable signaling solution in SDP for describing and negotiating 
		simulcast streams, within the context of the Real Time Transport Protocol(RTP).

    </section>

    <section title="Solution Overview" toc="default">
      <t>
        The source-attribute specification <xref target="RFC5576"/> provides mechanisms 
        describing Real-Time Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550"/>  sources, 
        identified by their synchronization source (SSRC) identifier, 
        in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/>, 
        to associate attributes with these sources, and to express relationships 
        among individual sources.
      </t>
      <t>
        To describe and negotiate simulcast streams with in SDP for a given media source, 
        the following framework is been proposed:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t> 
            Each physical media source is represented by its own unique m-line. 
            This is a strict one-to-one mapping; a single media source device cannot
            be spread across several m-lines, nor may a single m-line represent multiple 
            media sources.
          </t>
          <t>  
            Each simulcast media stream is marked with an a=ssrc attribute to correlate
            it with its RTP Packets
          </t>
          <t>
            A new SSRC Grouping semantic is proposed to express the simulcast 
            relationship between the media streams.
          </t> 
          <t>
             In the absence of the above grouping semantic, multiple SSRCs in a single m-line 
             are interpreted as alternate sources for the same media source.
          </t>
          <t>
             For multi-resolution simulcast, <xref target="RFC6236"/>  imageattr is 
             proposed for  a=ssrc attribute line, to specify send multiple resolutions, 
             for example.
           </t>
           <t>
             For the receiver control of selecting the simulcast stream to receive, the mechanisms
             defined in <xref target="I-D.lennox-mmusic-sdp-source-selection"/> is proposed.
           </t>
           <t>
             When multicast topology is used to distribute RTP/RTCP packets, having
             same multicast address across all the m=lines is proposed when multiplexing
             framework such as BUNDLE <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"/>
             is in operation.
           </t>
        </list> 
      </t>
      <t>
      Providing explicit resolutions on a per-SSRC basis for SIMULCAST groupings 
      allows an intermediary (such as a Media Translator <xref target="RFC5117"/>) 
      to be able to select an appropriate SIMULCAST layer without inspecting 
      the media stream, which could otherwise require decrypting and possibly 
      partially decoding media packets.

          camera source. It also describes different resolutions for each encoded

	<section title="Offer/Answer Consideration">
	  <t>
	     The Offer/Answer model for this specification adheres to the model as applicable
	     to Source-Specific Media SDP attributes <xref target="RFC5576"/> and its extensions
	     <xref target="I-D.lennox-mmusic-sdp-source-selection"/>.

	<section anchor="simulmux" title="Simulcast and Multiplexing ">
	  <t>
	    Multiplexing in RTP can be achieved in several ways as listed:
	    <list style="symbol">
	      <t> Payload Type based Multiplexing </t>
	      <t> Media Stream Multiplexing based on SSRC in a Single RTP Session </t>
	      <t> RTP Session Multiplexing over a single Media Transport.</t>
	    </list>
	  </t>
	  <t>
	   The proposed solution in this document assumes Media Stream Multiplexing
	   to transport the simulcast encodings from several media sources 
	   with in a single RTP Session,whenever possible. Such a solution can be envisioned
	   by the usage of multiplexing frameworks, such as, BUNDLE 
	   <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation"/>. In the absence of such
	   a framework, each media source gets its own RTP Session with its associated 
	   simulcast encodings multiplexed based on their respective SSRCs.
	  </t>  
	</section>
	<section anchor="simultopo" title="Simulcast under Multicast RTP Topology ">
	  <t>
	   <xref target="RFC5117"/> describes several underlying network topologies
	   supported by RTP. In this section the operation of the solution under 
	   multicast topologies is analyzed.
	  </t>
	   <t> 
	    The proposed solution enables right behavior for RTCP reporting across 
	    the members of the group, since all the sources and their simulcast streams
	    form a single RTP Session under the BUNDLE multiplexing framework.
	  </t> 
	   <t>
	    In the scenarios where using a single 5-tuple for all the media sources 
	    is not possible, carrying each source with its simulcast encodings in its own 
	    RTP Session ensures correct behavior.
	  </t>    
 	  <t>
 	    Allowing media sources to send different simulcast encodings to different multicast 
 	    group addresses is not directly enabled within the solution proposed. 
 	    Such a situation might arise to enable the receivers to selectively choose the
 	    multicast groups based on their receiving capabilities or interests.
 	    However, the mechanisms defined in 
 	    <xref target="I-D.lennox-mmusic-sdp-source-selection"/> enables receiver
 	    control  to selectively choose the simulcast streams of interest.
