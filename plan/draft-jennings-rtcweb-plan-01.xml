    <abstract>
      <t>This draft outlines a bunch of the remaining issues in RTCWeb related
      to how the the W3C APIs map to various usages of RTP and the associated
      SDP. It proposes one possible solution to that problem and outlines
      several chunks of work that would need to be put into other drafts or
      result in new drafts being written. The underlying design guideline is to,
      as much as possible, re-use what is already defined in existing SDP
      [RFC4566] and RTP [RFC3550] specifications.</t>

      <t>This draft is not intended to become an specification but is meant for
      working group discussion to help build the specifications. It is being
      discussed on the rtcweb@ietf.org mailing list though it has topics
      relating to the CLUE WG, MMUSIC WG, AVT* WG, and WebRTC WG at W3C. </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Overview">
      <t>The reoccurring theme of this draft is that SDP <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref> already has a way of solving many of the problems
      being discussed at the RTCWeb WG and we SHOULD not try to invent something new
      but rather re-use the existing methods for describing RTP <xref
      target="RFC3550" /> media flows.</t>

      <t> The general theory is that, roughly speaking,  the m-line corresponds
      to flow of packets that can be handled by the application in the same
      way. This often results in more m-lines than there are media sources such
      as microphones or cameras. Forward Error Correction (FEC) is done with
      multiple M-lines as shown in <xref target="RFC4756"></xref>. Retransmission 
      (RTX) is done with multiple m-lines as shown in <xref target="RFC4588"></xref>. 
      Layered coding is done with multiple m-lines as shown in <xref target="RFC5583"></xref>. 
      Simulcast, which is really just multiple video stream from the same camera, much 
      like layered coding but with no inter m-line dependency, is done with multiple
      m-lines modeled after the Layered coding defined in in <xref target="RFC5583"></xref>. 
      </t>

      <t> The significant addition to SDP semantics is an multi-render media
      level attribute that allows a device to indicate that it makes sense to
      simultaneously use multiple stream of video that will be simultaneously
      displayed but share the same SDP characteristics and semantics such that
      they can all be negotiated under a single m-line. When using features like
      RTX, FEC, and Simulcast in a multireder situation, there needs to be a
      way to correlate a given related media flow with the correct "base"
      media-flow. This is accomplished by having the related flows carry, in the
      CSRC, the SSRC of their base flow. An example SDP might look like as provided
      in the example <xref target="sec-mult-render-example" />. </t>

      <t> This draft also propose that advanced usages, including WebRTC to
      WebRTC scenarios, uses a Media Stream Identifier (MSID) that is signalled
      in SDP and also attempts to negotiate the usage of a RTP header extension
      to include the MSID in the RTP packet. This resolves many long term issues. </t>

      <t>This does results in lots of m lines but all the alternatives designs resulted
      in an roughly equivalent number of SSRC lines with a possibility of
      redefining most of the media level attributes. So it's really hard to see
      the big benefits defining something new over what we have. 

      One of the concerns about this approach is the time to collect all the ICE
      candidates needed for the initial offer. <xref target="sec-mult-render-example" /> provides mitigations
      to reduce the number of ports needed to be the same as an alternative SSRC
      based design.

      This assumes that it is perfectly feasible to transport
      SDP that much larger than a single MTU. The SIP <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref> usage of SDP has successfully passed over this
      long ago. In the cases where the SDP is passed over web mechanisms, it is
      easy to use compression and the size of SDP is more of an optimization
      criteria than a limiting issue.</t>

      <t hangText="Note">This draft avoids using terms that implementors do
      not have a clear idea of exactly what they are - for example RTP

    <section anchor="sec-req" title="Requirements">

      <t>The requirements listed here are a collection of requirements that
      have come from WebRTC, CLUE, and the general community that uses RTP for
      interactive communications based on Offer/Answer. It does not try to
      meet the needs of streaming usages or usages involving multicast. This
      list also does not try to list every possible requirement but instead
      outlines the ones that might influence the design. <list style="symbols">

          <t>Devices with multiple audio and/or video sources</t>

          <t>Mapping W3C PeerConnection (PC) aspects into SDP and RTP. It is

          <t>Synchronization - It needs to be clear how implementations deal
          with synchronization, in particular usages of both CNAME and LS group.
          The sender needs be able to indicate which Media Flows are intended

          <t>Redundant codings - The ability to send some media, such as the
          audio from a microphone, multiple times. For example it may be sent
          with a high quality wideband codec and a low bandwidth codec. If
          packets are lost from the high bandwidth steam, the low bandwidth

          comes from a tablet computer. This results in situations where the SDP

    <section title="Background/Solution Overview">
      <t>
	The basic unit of media description in SDP is the m-line/m-block.
	This allows any entity defined by a single m-block to be
	individually negotiated. This negotiation applies not only
	to individual sources (e.g., cameras) but also to individual
	components that come from a single source, such as layers
	in SVC.
      </t>
      <t>
	For example, consider negotiation of FEC as defined in
	<xref target="RFC4756"/>.

	</figure>
	<t>
	  When FEC is expressed this way,
	  the answerer can selectively accept or reject the various
	  streams by setting the port in the m-line to zero.
	  RTX <xref target="RFC4588"></xref>, layered coding <xref target="RFC5583"></xref>,
	  and Simulcast are all handled the same way.
	  Note that while it is also possible to represent FEC and SVC using
	  source-specific attributes <xref target="RFC5576"/>,
	  that mechanism is less flexible because it does not permit
	  selective acceptance and rejection as described in
	  [RFC 5576; Section 8]. Most deployed systems which
	  implement FEC, layered coding, etc. do so with each
	  component on a separate m-line.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Unfortunately, this strategy runs into problems when
	  combined with two new features that are desired for
	  WebRTC:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText ="m-line multiplexing (bundle):"></t>
	    <t>The ability to send media described in multiple
	    media over the same 5-tuple.</t>

	    <t></t>
	    <t hangText="multi-rendering:"></t>
	    <t>The ability to have large numbers of multiple similar media flows 
	    (e.g., multiple cameras).
	    The paradigmatic case here is multiple video thumbnails.</t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  Obviously, this strategy does not scale to large numbers
	  For instance, consider the case where
	  we want to be able to transmit 35 video thumbnails (this is large,
	  but not insane). In the model described above, each of these
	  flows would need its own m-line and its own set of codecs.
	  If each side supports three separate codecs (e.g.,
	  H.261, H.263, and VP8), then we have just consumed 105
	  payload types, which exceeds the available dynamic payload
	  space.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In order to resolve this issue, it is necessary to have multiple
	  flows (e.g., multiple thumbnails) indicated by the same m-line
	  and using the same set of payload types (see Section XXX for
	  proposed syntax for this.) Because each source has its own
	  SSRC, it is possible to divide the RTP packets into individual
	  flows. However, this solution still leaves us with two problems:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>How to individually address specific RTP flows in order to,
	    for instance, order them on a page or display flow-specific
	    captions.</t>
	    
	    <t>How to determine the relationship between multiple variants
	    of the same stream. For instance, if we have multiple cameras
	    each of which is present in a layered encoding, we need to
	    be able to determine which layers go together.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  For reasons described in <xref target="sec-overall-design"/>,
	  the SSRC learned visa SDP is not suitable for individually addressing RTP flows.
	  Instead, we introduce a new identifier, the MSID, which can
	  be carried both in the SDP and the RTP and therefore can
	  be used to correlate SDP elements to RTP elements.
	  See <xref target="sec-msid"/>
	</t>
	<t>
	  By contrast, we can use RTP-only mechanisms to express
	  the correlation between RTP flows: while all the flows
	  associated with a given camera have distinct SSIDs,
	  we can use the CSRC to indicate which flows belong
	  together. This is described in <xref target="sec-multi-render"/>
	</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Overall Design" anchor="sec-overall-design">
      <t>
	The basic unit of media description in SDP is the m-line/m-block and this
	document continues with that assumption. In general, different cameras,
	microphones, etc. are carried on different m-lines. The exceptions to
	this rule is when using the multi-render extension in which case:
      </t>
      <t>
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>Multiple sources which are semantically equivalent and multiplexed
	  on a time-wise basis.  For instance, if an MCU mixes multiple camera
	  feeds but only some subset is displayed at a time, they can all appear
	  on the same m-line.</t>

	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	By contrast, multiple sources which are semantically distinct cannot
	appear on the same m-line because that does not allow for clear
	negotiation of which sources are acceptable, or which sets of RTP SSRCs
	correspond to which flow.
      </t>
      <t>
	The second basic assumption is that SSRCs cannot always be safely used to
	associate RTP flows with information in the SDP.  There are two reasons
	for this. First, in an offer/answer setting, RTP can appear at the
	offerer before the answer is received; if SSRC information from the
	offerer is required, then these RTP packets cannot be interpreted.
	The second reason  is that RTP permits SSRCs to be changed at
	any time.
      </t>
      <t>
	This assumption makes clear why the two exceptions to the "one flow per
	m-line" rule work. In the case of time-based multiplexing (multi render)
	of camera sources, all the cameras are equivalent from the receiver's
	perspective; he merely needs to know which ones to display now and he
	does that based on which ones have been most recently received. In the
	case of multiple versions of the same content, 
        payload types or payload types plus SSRC can be used
	to distinguish the different versions.

	  Note that in this case the payload types must be distinct between
	  the two video m-lines, because that is what is used to demultiplex.

    <section anchor="sec-solutions" title="Solutions">
      <t>This section outlines a set of rules for the usage of SDP and RTP that
      seems to deal with the various problems and issues that have been
      discussed. Most of these are not new and are pretty much how many systems
      do it today. Some of them are new, but all the items requiring new
      standardization work are called out in the <xref
      target="sec-tasks"/>. </t>
      <t>
        Approach:
        <list
          style="numbers">
          <t>If a system wants to offer to send two sources, such as two camera, it MUST use a
          separate m-block for each source. The means that each  PC-Track corresponds to one or more m-blocks.</t>

          <t> In cases such as FEC, simulcast,
          SVC, each repair stream, layer, or simulcast media flow will get an m-block per media flow. </t>

          <t>If a systems wants to receive two streams of video to display in
          two different windows or screens, it MUST use separate m-blocks for
          each unless explicitly signaled to be otherwise (see <xref
          target="sec-multi-render"/>). </t>

          <t>Unless explicitly signaled otherwise (see <xref
          target="sec-multi-render"/>), if a given m-line receives media from
          multiple SSRCs, only media from the most recently received SSRC SHOULD
          be rendered and other SSRC SHOULD NOT and if it is video it SHOULD be
          rendered in the same window or screen.</t>

          <t>If a camera is sending simulcast video and three resolutions, each
          resolution MUST get its own m-block and all the three m-blocks will be
          grouped. A new SDP group will be defined for this.  </t>

          <t>If a camera is using a layered codec with three layers, there
          MUST be an m-block for each, and they will be grouped using
          standard SDP for grouping layers.</t>

          <t>To aid in synchronized playback, there is exactly one, and only
          one, LS group for each PC-Stream. All the m-blocks for all the
          PC-Tracks in a given PC-Stream are synchronized so they are all put in
          one LS group. All the PC-Tracks in a given PC-Stream have the same
          CNAME.  If a PC-Track appears in more than one PC-Stream, then all the
          PC-Streams with that PC-Track MUST have the same CNAME. </t>

          <t>One way media MUST use the sendonly or recvonly attributes.</t>

          <t>Media lines that are not currently in use but may be used later, so that
          the resources need to be kept allocated, SHOULD use the inactive
          attribute.</t>

          <t>If an m-line will not be used, or it is rejected, it MUST have its
          port set to zero.</t>

          <t>If a video switching MCU produces a virtual "active speaker" media
          flow, that media flow should have its own SSRC but include the SSRC
          of the current speaker's video in the CSRC packets it produces.</t>

          <t>For each PC-Track, the W3C API MUST provide a way to set and read
          the CSRC list, set and read the content RFC 4574 "label", and read the
          SSRC of last packet received on a PC-Track.</t>

          <t>The W3C API should have a constraint or API method to allow a
          PC-Stream to indicate the number of multi-render video streams it can
          accept. Each time a new stream is received up to the maximum, a new
          PC-Track will be created.</t>

          <t>Applications MAY signal all the SSRC they intend to send using RFC
          5576, but receivers need to be careful in their usage of the SSRC in
          signaling, as the SSRC can change when there is a collision and it
          takes time before that will be updated in signaling. </t>

          <t>Applications can get out of band "roster information" that maps the
          names of various speakers or other information to the MSID and/or
          SSRCs that a user is using</t>

          <t>Applications MAY use RFC 4574 content labels to indicate the
          purpose of the video. The additional content types, main-left and
          main-right, need to be added to support two- and three-screen
          systems.</t>

          <t>The CLUE WG might want to consider SDP to signal the 3D location
          and field of view parameters for captures and renderers.</t>

          <t> The W3C API allows a "label" to be set for the PC-Track. This MUST
          be mapped to the SDP label attribute. </t>

        </list></t>

        <section anchor="sec-msid" title="Correlation and Multiplexing">

          <t> The port number that RTP is received on provides the primary
          mechanism for correlating it to the correct m-line. However, when the
          port does not uniquely male the RTP packet to the correct m-block
          (such as in multiplexing and other cases), the next thing that can be
          looked at is the PT number. Finally there are cases where SSRC can be
          used if that was signaled. </t>

          <t> There are some complications when using SSRC for correlation with
          signaling. First, the offerer may end up receiving RTP packets before
          receiving the signaling with the SSRC correlation information. This is
          because the sender of the RTP chooses the SSRC; there is no way for
          the receiver to signal how some of the bits in the SSRC should be
          set. Numerous attempts to provide a way to do this have been made, but
          they have all been rejected for various reasons, so this situation is
          unlikely to change. The second issue is that the signaled SSRC can
          change, particularly in collision cases, and there is no good way to
          know when SSRC are changing, such that the currently signaled SSRC
          usage maps to the actual RTP SSRC usage. Finally SSRC does not always
          provide correlation information between media flows - take for example
          trying to look at SSRC to tell that an audio media flow and video
          media flow came from the same camera. The nice thing about SSRC is
          that they are also included in the RTP. </t>

          <t> The proposal here is to extend the MSID draft to meet these needs:
          each media flow would have a unique MSID and the MSID would have some
          level of internal structure, which would allow various forms of
          correlation, including what WebRTC needs to be able to recreate the
          MS-Stream / MS-Track hierarchy to be the same on both sides. In
          addition, this work proposes creating an optional RTP header extension
          that could be used to carry the MSID for a media flow in the RTP
          packets. This is not absolutely needed for the WebRTC use cases but it
          helps in the case where media arrives before signaling and it helps
          resolve a broader category of web conferencing use cases. </t>

          <t> The MSID consists of three things and can be extended to have
          more. It has a device identifier, which corresponds to a unique
          identifier of the device that created the offer; one or more
          synchronization context identifiers, which is a number that helps
          correlate different synchronized media flows; and a media flow
          identifier. The synchronization identifier and flow identifier are
          scoped within the context of the device identifier, but the device
          identifier is globally unique. The suggested device identifier is a
          64-bit random number. The synchronization group is an integer that is
          the same for all media flows that have this device identifier and are
          meant to be synchronized. Right now there can be more than one
          synchronization identifier, but the open issues suggest that one would
          be preferable. The flow identifier is an integer that uniquely
          identifies this media flow within the context of the device
          identifier.  </t>

          <t> Open Issues: how to know if the MSID RTP Header Extension should
          be included in the RTP? </t>

          <t>
            An example MSID for a device identifier of 12345123451234512345,
            synchronization group of 1, and a media flow id of 3 would be:
            <list> 
              <t> a=msid:12345123451234512345 s:1 f:3 </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t> When the MSID is used in an answer, the MSID also has the remote
          device identifier included. In the case where the device ID of
          the device sending the answer was 22222333334444455555, the MSID would
          look like:  <list> 
            <t> a=msid:22222333334444455555 s:1 f:3 r:12345123451234512345</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t> Note: The 64 bit size for the device identifier was chosen as it
          allows less than a one in a million chance of collision with greater
          than 10,000 flows (actually it allows this probability with more like
          6 million flows). Much smaller numbers could be used but 32 bits is
          probably too small. More discussion on the size of this and the color
          of the bike shed is needed. </t>

          <t> When used in the WebRTC context, each PeerConnection should
          generate a unique device identifier. Each PC-Stream in the
          PeerConnection will get a a unique synchronization group identifier,
          and each PC-Track in the Peer Connection will get a unique flow
          identifier. Together these will be used to form the MSID. The MSID
          MUST be included in the SDP offer or answer so that the WebRTC
          connection on the remote side can form the correct structure of remote
          PC-Streams and PC-Tracks. If a WebRTC client receives an Offer with no
          MSID information and no LS group information, it MUST put all the
          remote PC-Tracks into a single PC-Stream. If there is LS group
          information but no MSID, a PC-Stream for each LS group MUST be created
          and the PC-Tracks put in the appropriate PC-Stream.  </t>

          <t> The W3C specs should be updated to have the ID attribute of the
          MS-Stream be the MSID with no flow identifier, and the ID attribute of
          the MS-Track be the MSID. </t>

          <t> In addition, the SDP will attempt to negotatiate sending the MSID
          in the RTP using a RTP Header Extension. WebRTC clients SHOULD also
          include the a=ssrc attributes if they know which SSRC they plan to
          send but they can not rely on this not changing, being compete, or
          existing in all offers or answers they receive - particularly when
          working with SIP endpoints. </t>

          <t> When using multiplexing, the SDP MUST be distinct enough where the
          combination of payload type number and SSRC allows for unique
          demultiplexing of all the media on the same transport flow without use
          of MSID though the MSID can help in several use cases. </t>

        </section>

      <section anchor="sec-multi-render" title="Multiple Render">
        <t>There are cases - such as a grid of security cameras or thumbnails in
        a video conference - where a receiver is willing to receive and display
        several media flows of video. The proposal here is to create a new media
        level attribute called multiple-render that includes an integer that
        indicates how many streams can be rendered at the same time.</t>

        <t>As an example, a system that could display 16 thumbnails at the same
        time and was willing to receive H261 or H264 might offer</t>

        <t>When combining this muliple-render feature with multiplexing, the
        answer will might not know all the SSRCs that will be send to this m-block
        so it is best to use payload type (PT) numbers that are unique for the
        SDP: the demultiplexing may have to only use the PT if the SSRCs are
        unknown.</t>

        <t> The intention is that the most recently sent SSRC are the ones that
        are rendered. Some switching MCU will likely only send the correct
        number of SSRC and not change the SSRC but will instead update the CSRC
        as the switching MCU select a different participant to include in the
        particular video stream. </t>

        recent 16 SSRC to send video to m-block.</t>

    <section title="Open Issues">
      <t> The overall solution is complicated considerably by the fact that
      WebRTC allows a PC-Track to be used in more than one PC-Stream but
      requires only one copy of the RTP data for the track to be sent.  I am not
      aware of any use case for this and think it should be removed. If a
      PC-Track needs to be synchronized with two different things, they should
      all go in one PC-Stream instead of two. </t>

        <t>This means that a sender can switch back and forth between H261 and
        MVP without any further signaling. The receiver MUST be capable of
        receiving both formats. At any point in time, only one video format is

            Lines in the Session Description Protocol". In addition, an

            streams in a "DDP" group indicated by media identification
            attribute(s) and media format description(s).
