    <abstract>
      <t>This draft outlines a bunch of the remaining issues in RTCWeb related
      to how the the W3C APIs map to various usages of RTP and the associated
      SDP. It proposes one possible solution to that problem and outlines
      several chunks of work that would need to be put into other drafts or
      result in new drafts being written. The underlying design guideline is to,
      as much as possible, re-use what is already defined in existing SDP
      [RFC4566] and RTP [RFC3550] specifications.</t>

      <t>This draft is not intended to become an specification but is meant for
      working group discussion to help build the specifications. It is being
      discussed on the webrtc@ietf.org mailing list though it has topics
      relating to the CLUE WG, MMUSIC WG, AVT* WG, and WebRTC WG at W3C. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The reoccurring theme of this draft is that SDP <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref> already has a way of solving the problems being
      discussed at the RTCWeb WG and we not try to invent something new
      but rather re-use the existing methods instead.</t>

      <t>This does results in lots of m lines but all the alternatives resulted
      in an nearly equivalent number of ssrc lines with a possibility of
      redefining most of the media level attributes. So it's really hard to see
      the big difference.This assumes that it is perfectly feasible to transport
      SDP that much larger than a single MTU. The SIP <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref> usage of SDP has successfully passed over this
      long ago. In the cases where the SDP is passed over web mechanisms, it is
      easy to use compression and it is more of an optimization criteria than a
      limiting issue.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
      "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
      interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This draft uses the API and terminology described in <xref
      target="webrtc-api"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Transport-Flow: 5 Tuple representing a RTP association.</t>

      <t>5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source IP address,
      source trasport port, destination IP address, destination transport port
      and transport protocol.</t>

      <t>PC-Track: A source of media (audio and/or video) that is contained in a
      PC-Stream. A PC-Track represents content comprising one or more
      PC-Channels.</t>

      <t>PC-Channel: Smallest unit of a PC-Track representing inter-related
      media aspects such as stereo or 5.1 audio signal</t>

      <t>PC-Stream: Represents stream of data of audio and/or video added to a
      Peer Connection by local or remote media source(s). A PC-Stream is made up
      of zero or more PC-Tracks.</t>

      <t>m-line: An <xref target="RFC4566">RFC4566</xref> media description
      identifier that starts with "m=" field and conveys following values:media
      type,transport port,transport protocol and media format descriptions.</t>

      <t>m-block: An <xref target="RFC4566">RFC4566</xref> media description
      that starts with an m-line and is terminated by either the next m-line or
      by the end of the session description.</t>

      <t>Offer: An <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> SDP message generated by the
      participant who wishes to initiate a multimedia communication session.
      An Offer describes participants capabilities for engaging in a multimedia
      session.</t>

      <t>Answer: An <xref target="RFC3264"></xref> SDP message generated by the
      participant in response to an Offer. An Answer describes participants
      capabilities in continuing with the multimedia session with in the
      constraints of the Offer.</t>

      <t hangText="Note">This draft avoids using terms that implementors do
      not have a clear idea of exactly what they are - for example RTP
      Session.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-req" title="Requirements">
      <t>The requirements listed here are a collection of requirements that
      have come from WebRTC, CLUE, and the general community that uses RTP for
      interactive communications based on Offer/Answer. It does not try to
      meet the needs of streaming usages or usages involving multicast. This
      list does not also try to list every possible requirement but instead
      outlines the ones that might influence the design. <list style="symbols">
          <t>Devices with multiple cameras</t>

          <t>Devices that display multiple streams of video</t>

          <t>Simulcast, wherein a video from a single camera is sent in a few
          independent video streams typically at different resolutions and
          frame rates.</t>

          <t>Layered Codec such as H.264 SVC</t>

          <t>One way media flows and bi-directional media flows</t>

          <t>Mapping W3C PeerConnection (PC) aspects into SDP and RTP. It is
          important that the SDP be descriptive enough that both sides can get
          the same view of various identifiers for PC-Tracks, PC-Streams and
          their relationships.</t>

          <t>Support of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref
          target="RFC5245"></xref></t>

          <t>Support of Multiplexing such as SSRC Multiplexing, RTP Session
          Multiplexing</t>

          <t>Synchronization - It needs to be clear how implementations deal
          with synchronization, in particular usages of both CNAME and LS group.
          The sender needs be able to indicate which Media Flows are intended 
          to be synchronized and which are not.</t>

          <t>Redundant codings - The ability to send some media, such as the
          audio from a microphone, multiple times. For example it may be sent
          with a high quality wideband codec and a low bandwidth codec. If
          packets are lost from the high bandwidth steam, the low bandwidth
          stream can be used to fill in the missing gaps of audio. This is
          very simular to simulcast.</t>

          <t>Forward Error Correction - Support for various RTP FEC
          schemes.</t>

          <t>RSVP QoS - Ability to signal varions QoS mechanism such SRF
          group</t>

          <t>Desegregated Media (FID group) - There is a growing desire to
          deal with endpoints that are distributed - for example a video phone
          where the incoming video is displayed on the an IP TV but the
          outgoing video comes from a tablet computer. This results in
          situations where the SDP sets up a session with not all the media
          transmitted to a single IP address.</t>

          <t>In flight change of codec: Support for system that can negotiate
          the uses of more than one codec for a given media flow and then the
          sender can arbitrarily switch between them when they are sending but
          they only send with one codec as at time.</t>

          <t>Support for Sequential and Parallel forking at the SIP level</t>

          <t>Support for Early Media</t>

          <t>Conferencing environments with Transcoding MCU that
          decodes/mixes/recodes the media</t>

          <t>Conferencing environments with Switching MCU where the MCU mucks
          the header information of the media and do not decode/recode all the
          media</t>

    <section anchor="sec-solutions" title="Solutions">
      <t>This section outlines a set of rules for the usage of SDP and RTP that
      seems to deal with the various problems and issues that have been
      discussed. Most of these are not new and are pretty much how many systems
      do it today. Some of them are new, but all the items requiring new
      standardization work are called out in the TODO Section-tasks: <list
          style="numbers">
          <t>If a system wants to offer to send two cameras, it MUST use a
          separate m-block for each camera.</t>

          <t>If a systems wants to receive two streams of video to display in
          two different windows or screens, it MUST user separate m-blocks for
          each.</t>

          <t>Unless explicitly signalled otherwise (see section TODO ref multi
          render), if a given m-line receives media from multiple SSRCs, only
          media from the most recently received SSRC SHOULD be rendered and
          other SSRC SHOULD not and if it is video it SHOULD be rendered in the
          same window or screen.</t>

          <t>Each PC-Track corresponds to one or more m-blocks.</t>

          <t>If a camera is sending simulcast video and three resolutions, each
          resolution MUST get its own m-block and all the three m-blocks will
          be grouped using TBD.</t>

          <t>If a camera is using a layered codec with three layers, there
          MUST be an m-block for each, and they will be grouped using
          TBD.</t>

          <t>To aid in synchronized playback, there is exactly one, and only one, LS
          group for each PC-Stream. All the m-blocks for all the PC-Tracks in a
          given PC-Stream are synchronized so they are all put in one LS
          group. All the PC-Tracks in a given PC-Stream have the same CNAME.  If
          a PC-Track appears in more than one PC-Stream, then all the PC-Streams 
          with that PC-Track MUST have the same CNAME. </t>

          <t>One way media MUST use the sendonly or recvonly attributes.</t>

          <t>Media lines that are not currently in use but may be used later, so that
          the resources need to be kept allocated, SHOULD use the inactive
          attribute.</t>

          <t>If an m-line will not be used, or it is rejected, it MUST have its
          port set to zero.</t>

          <t>If a video switching MCU produces a virtual "active speaker" media
          flow, that media flow should have its own SSRC but include the SSRC
          of the current speaker's video in the CSRC packets it produces.</t>

          <t>For each PC-Track, the W3C API MUST provide a way to set and read
          the CSRC list, set and read the content label, and read the SSRC of last packet received on
          a PC-Track.</t>

          <t>The W3C api should have a constraint or API method to allow a
          PC-Stream to indicate the number of multi-render video streams it
          can accept. Each time a new steam is received up to the maximum, a
          new PC-Track will be created.</t>

          <t>Applications MAY signal all the SSRC they intend to send using the
          TODO, but receivers need to be careful in their usage of the SSRC in signaling, as the SSRC
          can change when there is a collision and it takes time before that will be updated in signaling. </t>

          <t>Applications can get out of band "roster information" that maps the
          names of various speakers or other information to the MSID and/or SSRCs
          that a user is using</t>

          <t>Applications SHOULD use the TODO ref content labels to indicate the
          purpose of the video. The additional content types, main-left and
          main-right, need to be added to support two- and three-screen systems.</t>

          <t>The CLUE WG might want to consider adding SDP to signal the 3D
          location and field of view parameters for captures and
          renderers.</t> 

          <t> The W3C API allows a "label" to be set for the PC-Track. This MUST
          be mapped to the SDP label attribute. </t>

        </list></t>

        <section anchor="sec-msid" title="Correlation and Multiplexing">

          <t> The port number that RTP is received on provides the primary
          mechanism for correlating it to the correct m-line. However, when the port does not uniquely male the RTP packet to the correct m-block (such as in multiplexing and other cases), the next thing that can be looked at is the PT
          number. Finally there are cases where SSRC can be used if that was
          signalled. </t>

          <t> There are some complications when using SSRC for correlation with
          signaling. First, the offerer may end up receiving RTP packets before
         receiving the signaling with the SSRC correlation
          information. This is because the sender of the RTP chooses the SSRC;
          there is no way for the receiver to signal how some of the bits
          in the SSRC should be set. Numerous attempts to
          provide a way to do this have been made, but they have all been rejected for various
          reasons, so this situation is unlikely to change. The second issue is that the
          signalled SSRC can change, particularly in collision cases, and there
          is no good way to know when SSRC are changing, such that the currently
          signalled SSRC usage maps to the actual RTP SSRC usage. Finally SSRC
          does not always provide correlation information between media flows - take for
          example trying to look at SSRC to tell that an audio media flow and
          video media flow came from the same camera. The nice thing about SSRC
          is that they are also included in the RTP. </t>

          <t> The proposal here is to extend the MSID draft to meet these needs:
          each media flow would have a unique MSID and the MSID would have some
          level of internal structure, which would allow various forms of correlation,
          including what WebRTC needs to be able to recreate the MS-Stream /
          MS-Track hierarchy to be the same on both sides. In addition, this work
          proposes creating an optional RTP header extension that could be used
          to carry the MSID for a media flow in the RTP packets. This is not
          absolutely needed for the WebRTC use cases but it helps in the case
          where media arrives before signaling and it helps resolve a
          broader category of web conferencing use cases. </t>

          <t> The MSID consists of three things and can extended to have
          more. It has a device identifier, which corresponds to a unique
          identifier of the device that created the offer; one or more
          synchronization context identifiers, which is a number that helps
          correlate different synchronized media flows; and a media flow
          identifier. The synchronization identifier and flow identifier are
          scoped within the context of the device identifier, but the device
          identifier is globally unique. The suggested device identifier is a
          64-bit random number. The synchronization group is an integer that is
          the same for all media flows that have this device identifier and are
          meant to be synchronized. Right now there can be more than one
          synchronization identifier, but the open issues suggest that one would
          be preferable. The flow identifier is an integer that uniquely
          identifies this media flow within the context of the device
          identifier.  </t>
          <t>
            An example MSID for a device identifier of 12345123451234512345,
            synchronization group of 1, and a media flow id of 3 would be:
            <list> 
              <t> a=msid:12345123451234512345 s:1 f:3 </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t> When the MSID is used in an answer, the MSID also has the remote
          device identifier included. In the case where the device ID of
          the device sending the answer was 22222333334444455555, the MSID would
          look like:  <list> 
              <t> a=msid:12345123451234512345 s:1 f:3 r:22222333334444455555</t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t> Note: The 64 bit size for the device identifier was chosen as it
          allows less than a one in a million chance of collision with greater than
          10,000 flows (actually it allows this probability with more like 6 million
          flows). Much smaller numbers could be used but 32 bits is probably too
          small. More discussion on the size of this and the color of the bike
          shed is needed. </t> 

          <t> When used in the WebRTC context, each PeerConnection should
          generate a unique device identifier. Each PC-Stream in the
          PeerConnection will get a a unique synchronization group identifier,
          and each PC-Track in the Peer Connection will get a unique flow
          identifier. Together these will be used to form the MSID. The MSID MUST
          be included in the SDP offer or answer so that the WebRTC
          connection on the remote side can form the correct structure of remote
          PC-Streams and PC-Tracks. If a WebRTC client receives an Offer with no
          MSID information and no LS group information, it MUST put all the
          remote PC-Tracks into a single PC-Stream. If there is LS group
          information but no MSID, a PC-Stream for each LS group MUST be created
          and the PC-Tracks put in the appropriate PC-Stream.  </t>

          <t> The W3C specs should be updated to have the ID attribute of the
          MS-Stream be the MSID with no flow identifier, and the ID attribute
          of the MS-Track be the MSID. </t>

        </section>

      <section anchor="sec-multi-render" title="Multiple Render">
        <t>There are cases - such as a grid of security cameras or thumbnails in a video conference - where a receiver is willing to receive and display
        several media flows of video. The proposal
        here is to create a new media level attribute called multiple-render that
        includes an integer that indicates how many streams can be rendered at
        the same time.</t>

        <t>As an example, a system that could display 16 thumbnails at the same
        time and was willing to receive H261 or H264 might offer</t>

      <t> The overall solution is complicated considerably by the fact that WebRTC allows a PC-Track to be used in more than one
      PC-Stream but requires only one copy of the RTP data for the track to
      be sent.  I am not aware of any use
      case for this and think it should be removed. If a PC-Track needs to be
      synchronized with two different things, they should all go in one PC-Stream

        <t>This means that a sender can switch back and forth between H261
        and MVP without any further signaling. The receiver MUST be capable

            decoding dependency of different media descriptions with the same
            media type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). This is
            required, for example, if media data is separated and transported
            in different network streams as a result of the use of a layered
            or multiple descriptive media coding process.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; A
            new grouping type "DDP" -- decoding dependency -- is defined, to
            be used in conjunction with RFC 3388 entitled "Grouping of Media
            Lines in the Session Description Protocol". In addition, an
            attribute is specified describing the relationship of the media

            <t>This document defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
            media- level attribute, 'content'. The 'content' attribute defines
            the content of the media stream to a more detailed level than the
            media description line. The sender of an SDP session description
            can attach the 'content' attribute to one or more media streams.
            The receiving application can then treat each media stream
            differently (e.g., show it on a big or small screen) based on its
            content. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
