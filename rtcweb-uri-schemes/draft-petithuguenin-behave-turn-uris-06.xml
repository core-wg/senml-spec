			<t>This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) protocol.</t>

			<t>
				The TURN protocol is a specification allowing hosts behind NAT to control the operation of a relay server.
				The relay server allows hosts to exchange packets with its peers.
				The peers themselves may also be behind NATs.
				<xref target="RFC5766">RFC 5766</xref> defines the specifics of the TURN protocol.
			</t>

			<t>
				The "turn" and "turns" URI schemes are used to designate a TURN server (also known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using the TURN protocol.
				With the advent of standards such as <xref target="WEBRTC"/>, we anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to identify and communicate with such a TURN server to carry out the TURN protocol.
				This also implies those endpoints and/or applications to be provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify the TURN server.
				Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and can result in non-interoperable solutions.
				It can result in solutions that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on the different aspects of the syntax and alike.
				The "turn/turns" URI scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a TURN server.
				This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones proposed in <xref target="WEBRTC"/>, for example.
			</t>

			<t>
<xref target="RFC5928"/> defines a resolution mechanism to convert a secure flag, a host name or IP address, an eventually empty port, and an eventually empty transport to a list of IP address, port, and TURN transport tuples.</t>

			<t>To simplify the provisioning of TURN clients, this document defines a TURN and a TURNS URI scheme that can carry the four components needed for the resolution mechanism.</t>

				When these words are not in ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual english meanings, and are not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.

				This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref target="RFC6982"/>.
				The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
				Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
				Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
				This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
				Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
			</t>

			<t>
				According to <xref target="RFC6982"/>, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
				It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".

	A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
	that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
	defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
	that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
	considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
	The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
	allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
	reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
	possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
	grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
	specifications of each URI scheme.

					<t>
						The ABNF in this document duplicates the &lt;IP-literal&gt;, &lt;IPv4address&gt;, and &lt;reg-name&gt; productions and other dependent productions from <xref target="RFC3986"/>, instead of referencing them.
						This is because the definitions in RFC 3986 are for hierarchical URIs, so using these references in an opaque URI made reviewers think that a hierarchical URI parser could be used to parse the URIs defined in this document.
					</t>

					<t>
						One recurring comment was to stop using the suffix "s" on URI scheme, and to move the secure option to a parameter (e.g. ";proto=tls").
						We decided against this idea because the STUN URI does not have a ";proto=" parameter and we would have lost the symmetry between the TURN and STUN URIs.
						A more detailed account of the reasoning behind this is available at &lt;http://blog.marc.petit-huguenin.org/2012/09/on-design-of-stun-and-turn-uri-formats.html&gt;
					</t>

					<t>Following the advice of RFC 4395 section 2.2., and because the TURN URI does not describe a hierarchical structure, the TURN URIs are opaque URIs.</t>

					<t>
						&lt;password&gt; is not used in the URIs because it is deprecated <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
						&lt;username&gt; and &lt;auth&gt; are not used in the URIs because they do not guide the resolution mechanism.
					</t>

					<t>As discussed at IETF 72 in Dublin, there is no generic parameters in the URI to prevent compatibility issues.</t>

						<t>Remove the &lt;IP-literal&gt;, &lt;IPv4address&gt;, and &lt;reg-name&gt; ABNF productions and other dependant productions, added references to RFC 3986, and modified the design note to warn developers against using a hierarchical URI parser.</t>

						<t>Modify the release notes to add "auth" to the list of parameters not supported.</t>
						<t>Add clarification that RFC 5766 and 5928 are the references for finding the default port.</t>
						<t>Add paragraph in security section making clear tha reading RFC 5928 section 5 is essential.</t>
