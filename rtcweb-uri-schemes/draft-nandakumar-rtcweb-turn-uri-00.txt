Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for TURN              October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Traversal Using Relays
   around NAT (TURN) protocol.

   The TURN protocol is a specification allowing hosts behind NAT to
   control the operation of a relay server.  The relay server allows
   hosts to exchange packets with its peers.  The peers themselves may
   also be behind NATs.  RFC 5766 [RFC5766] defines the specifics of the
   TURN protocol.

   The 'turn/turns' URI scheme is used to designate a TURN server (also
   known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using the TURN
   protocol.  With the advent of standards such as WEBRTC [WEBRTC], we
   anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to
   identify and communicate with such a TURN server to carry out the
   TURN protocol.  This also implies those endpoints and/or applications
   to be provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify
   the TURN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and
   can result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in
   solutions that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on
   the different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The 'turn/turns' URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   TURN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in the WEBRTC Standards [WEBRTC], for example.

   The 'turn/turns' URI adheres to syntax as defined in RFC 3986
   [RFC3986].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  URI Scheme Definition

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The 'turn' URI takes the following form (the syntax below is non-
   normative):

Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for TURN              October 2011


      turn:<userinfo>@<host>:<port>

      turns:<userinfo>@<host>:<port>

   Where <userinfo> with the "@" (at) sign character, as well as the
   <port> part and the preceding ":" (colon) character, is OPTIONAL.

   The normative syntax of the 'turn' URI is defined as shown in the
   following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] rule:

   turn-uri      = turn-scheme ":" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
   turn-scheme   = "turn"/"turns"
   userinfo      = user [ ":" password ]
   user          = 1*(%x21-24 / %x26-39 / %x3B-3F / %x41-7F
                   / escaped)
                       ; The symbols "%", ":", "@", and symbols
                       ; with a character value below 0x21 may
                       ; be represented as escaped sequences.
   password      = 1*(%x21-24 / %x26-3F / %x41-7F / escaped)
                       ; The symbols "%", "@", and symbols with
                       ; a character value below 0x21 may be
                       ; represented as escaped sequences.
   host          = hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
   hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
   domainlabel   = alphanum / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
   toplabel      = ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
   IPv4address   = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
   IPv6reference = "[" IPv6address "]"
   IPv6address   = hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
   hexpart       = hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
   hexseq        = hex4 *( ":" hex4 )
   hex4          = 1*4HEXDIG
   port          = 1*DIGIT
   alphanum      = ALPHA / DIGIT
   escaped       = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

   The <host>, <port> and <userinfo> rules are described in Appendix A
   of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  The core rules <ALPHA>, <DIGIT> and
   <HEXDIGIT> are used as described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The TURN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-
   over-TCP.  The 'turns' URI scheme SHALL be used when TURN is run over
   TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP) and the 'turn' scheme
   SHALL be used otherwise.  The <host> part of the 'turn' URI, which is
   REQUIRED, denotes the TURN server host.  The <userinfo> part,
   identifies the credential required for the long-term credential

   mechanism as described in the section 10.2 of RFC 5389 [RFC5389].
   The <port> part, if present, denotes the port on which the TURN
   server is awaiting connection requests.  If it is absent, the default
   port SHALL be 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The default port for TURN
   over TLS SHALL be 5349.


4.  Examples

   URI to identify a long-term credential for the TLS-over-TCP
   connection to TURN server, example.com, on default port 5349:

      turns:username:password@example.com

   URI to identify a long-term credential for the connection to TURN
   server, example.com, on default port 3478:

      turn:username:password@example.com


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document instructs IANA to register the 'turn' and 'turns' URI
   schemes in the "Permanent URI Schemes" sub-registry in the "Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes" IANA registry [URIREG].  These
   registrations follows the URI Scheme Registration Template detailed
   in Section 5.4 of RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

5.1.  The 'turn' URI Scheme Registration

   IANA registration of the the 'turn' URI scheme:

      URI scheme name: turn

      Status: Permanent

      URI scheme syntax: see Section 3.1 of RFC XXXX [This document]

      URI scheme semantics: see Section 3.2 of RFC XXXX [This document]

      URI scheme encoding considerations: there are no other encoding
      considerations for 'turn' URIs that are not described in RFC 5766
      [RFC5766].

      Protocols that use the scheme: Traversal Using Relays around NAT
      (TURN)

5.2.  The 'turns' URI Scheme Registration

   IANA registration of the the 'turns' URI scheme:

      URI scheme name: turns

      Status: Permanent

      URI scheme syntax: see Section 3.1 of RFC XXXX [This document]

      URI scheme semantics: see Section 3.2 of RFC XXXX [This document]

      URI scheme encoding considerations: there are no other encoding
      considerations for 'turns' URIs that are not described in RFC 5766
      [RFC5766].

      Protocols that use the scheme: Traversal Using Relays around NAT
      (TURN) when run over TLS-over-TCP.

      Security Considerations: see Section 6 of RFC XXXX [This document]

      Contact: IESG <iesg@ietf.org>

      Author/Change controller: IETF <ietf@ietf.org>

      References: See Section 8 of RFC XXXX [This document]


6.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

   The URI Scheme defined by this document for the Traversal Using
   Relays around NAT (TURN) protocol does not introduce any security
   considerations beyond those detailed in Section 17 of RFC 5766
   [RFC5766].

   Since embedding password in the URI MAY cause security issues, it is
   expected that the credential MUST be passed over a secure transport
