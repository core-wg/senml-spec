                           SDP for the WebRTC
                     draft-nandakumar-rtcweb-sdp-04

Abstract

   The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) [WEBRTC] working group is
   charged to provide protocol support for direct interactive rich
   communication using audio, video and data between two peers' web
   browsers.  With in the WebRTC framework, Session Description protocol
   (SDP) [RFC4566] is used for negotiating session capabilities between
   the peers.  Such a negotiation happens based on the SDP Offer/Answer
   exchange mechanism described in the RFC 3264 [RFC3264].

   This documents provides an informational reference in describing the
   role of SDP and Offer/Answer exchange for the most common WebRTC use-
   cases.

   This SDP examples provided in this document is still a work in
   progress, but it aims to align closest to the evolving standards
   work.

Internet-Draft                 SDP4WebRTC                   January 2014


1.  Introduction

   Javascript Session Exchange Protocol(JSEP) [JSEP] specifies a generic
   protocol needed to generate [RFC3264] Offers and Answers negotiated
   between the WebRTC peers for setting up, updating and tearing down a
   WebRTC session.  For this purpose, SDP is used to construct [RFC3264]
   Offers/Answers for describing (media and non-media) streams as
   appropriate for the recipients of the session description to
   participate in the session.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows:  Section 3
   and 4 provides an overview of SDP and the Offer/Answer exchange
   mechanism.  Section 5 provides sample SDP generated for the most
   common WebRTC use-cases.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  SDP and the WebRTC

   The purpose of this section is to provide a general overview of SDP
   and its components.  For a more in-depth understanding, the readers
   are advised to refer to [RFC4566].

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] describes multimedia
   sessions, which can contain audio, video, whiteboard, fax, modem, and
   other streams.  SDP provides a general purpose, standard
   representation to describe various aspects of multimedia session such
   as media capabilities, transport addresses and related metadata in a
   transport agnostic manner, for the purposes of session announcement,
   session invitation and parameter negotiation.

   As of today SDP is widely used in the context of Session Initiation
   Protocol [RFC3261], Real-time Transport Protocol [RFC3550] and Real-
   time Streaming Protocol applications [RFC2326].

   Below figure introduces high-level breakup of SDP into components
   that semantically describe a multimedia session, in our case, a
   WebRTC session [WEBRTC].  It by no means captures everything about
   SDP and hence, should be used for informational purposes only.

   [WEBRTC] proposes JavaScript application to fully specify and control
   the signaling plane of a multimedia session as described in the JSEP

   specification [JSEP].  JSEP provides mechanisms to create session
   characterization and media definition information to conduct the
   session based on SDP exchanges.

   In this context, SDP serves two purposes:
   1.  Provide grammatical structure syntactically.
   2.  Semantically convey partipant's intention and capabilities
       required to successfully negotiate a session.


4.  Offer/Answer and the WebRTC

   This section introduces SDP Offer/Answer Exchange mechanism mandated
   by WebRTC for negotiating session capabilities while setting up,
   updating and tearing down a WebRTC session.  This section is
   intentionally brief in nature and interested readers are recommended
   to refer [RFC3264] for specific details on the protocol operation.

   The Offer/Answer [RFC3264] model specifies rule for the bilateral
   exchange of Session Description Protocol (SDP) messages for creation
   of multimedia streams.  It defines protocol with involved
   participants exchanging desired session characteristics from each
   others perspective constructed as SDP to negotiate the session
   between them.

   In the most basic form,the protocol operation begins by one of the
   participants sending an initial SDP Offer describing its intent to
   start a multimedia communication session.  The participant receiving
   the offer MAY generate an SDP Answer accepting the offer or it MAY
   reject the offer.  If the session is accepted the Offer/Answer model
   guarantees a common view of the multimedia session between the
   participants.

   At any time, either participant MAY generate a new SDP offer that
   updates the session in progress.

   With in the context of WebRTC, the Offer/Answer model defines the
   state-machinery for WebRTC peers to negotiate session descriptions
   between them during the initial setup stages as well as for eventual
   session updates.  Javascript Session Establishment Protocol
   specification [JSEP] for WebRTC provides the mechanism for generating
   [RFC3264] SDP Offers and Answers in order for both sides of the
   session to agree upon details such as list of media formats to be
   sent/received, bandwidth information, crypto parameters, transport
   parameters, for example.

5.  WebRTC Session Description Examples

   A typical web based real-time multimedia communication session can be
   characterized as below:

   o  It has zero or more Audio only, Video only or Audio/Video RTP
      Sessions,
   o  MAY contain zero or more non-media data sessions,
   o  All the sessions are secured with DTLS-SRTP,
   o  Supports NAT traversal using ICE mechanism,
   o  Provides RTCP based feedback mechanisms,
   o  Sessions can be over IPv4-only, IPv6-only, dual-stack based
      clients.

5.1.  Some Conventions

   The examples given in this document follow the conventions listed
   below:

   o  In all the examples, Alice and Bob are assumed to be the WebRTC
      peers.
   o  [draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] support for
      multiplexing several media streams on a single underlying
      transport is enabled by default unless explicitly specified
      otherwise.
   o  Call flow diagrams that accompany the use-cases capture only the
      prominent aspects of the system behavior and intentionally is not
      detailed to improve readability.
   o  The SDP examples deviate from actual on-the-wire SDP notation in
      several ways.  This is done to facilitate readability and to
      conform to the restrictions imposed by the RFC formatting rules.
      *  Any SDP line that is indented (compared to the initial line in
         the SDP block) is a continuation of the preceding line.  The
         line break and indent are to be interpreted as a single space
         character.
      *  Empty lines in any SDP example are inserted to make functional
         divisions in the SDP clearer, and are not actually part of the
         SDP syntax.
      *  Excepting the above two conventions, line endings are to be
         interpreted as <CR><LF> pairs (that is, an ASCII 13 followed by
         an ASCII 10).
   o  Against each SDP line, pointers to the appropriate RFCs are
      provide for further information reference.  Also an attempt has
      been made to provide explanatory notes to enable better
      understanding of the SDP usage, wherever appropriate.
   o  Following SDP details are common across all the use-cases defined
      in this document unless mentioned otherwise.

      *  DTLS fingerprint for SRTP (a=fingerprint)
      *  RTP/RTCP Multiplexing (a=rtcp-mux)
      *  RTCP Feedback support (a=rtcp-fb)
      *  Host and server-reflexive candidate lines (a=candidate)
      *  SRTP Setup framework parameters (a=setup)
      *  RTCP attribute (a=rtcp)
      *  RTP header extension indicate audio-levels from client to the
         mixer
      For more details, readers are recommended to refer to the
      Javascript Session Exchange Protocol(JSEP) [JSEP] specification.
   o  The term "Session" is used rather loosely in this document to
      refer to either a "Communication Session" or a "RTP Session" or a
      "RTP Stream" depending on the context.
   o  Payload type 109 is usually used for OPUS, 99 for H.264 and 120
      for VP8 in most of the examples to maintain uniformity.
   o  In the actual use that values that represent SSRCs, ICE candidate
      foundations, WebRTC Mediastream and MediaStreamTrack Ids can be
      much larger and random than the ones shown in the examples.
      [OPEN ISSUE-1]:  SDP Examples for Data Channel, Simulcast, SVC are
      still being discussed and doesn't represent the final solution.
      [OPEN ISSUE-2]:  API surface for controlling BUNDLE, TRICKLE-ICE
      are ignored for the time being.

5.2.  Basic Examples

5.2.1.  Two-Way Audio Only Session

   This common scenario shows SDP for secure Two-way audio session with
   Alice offering Opus, PCMU, PCMA and Bob accepting all the audio
   codecs offered.

   title 2-Way Audio Only Session

   participant Alice as Alice
   participant Bob as Bob

   Alice->Bob: Offer(Audio:Opus,PCMU,PCMA)
   Bob->Alice: Answer(Audio:Opus,PCMU,PCMA)
   Alice<->Bob: Two-way Opus Audio (preferred codec)

5.2.2.  Two-Way Audio/Video Session

   Alice and Bob establish an audio and video session with Opus as the
   audio codec and H.264 as the video codec.  This example also
   illustrates the negotiation of NACK based RTCP feedback mechanisms -
   PLI and FIR for the video session [RFC5104].

5.2.5.  Audio with DTMF Session

   In this example, Alice wishes to establish two separate audio
   streams, one for normal audio and the other for telephone-events.
   Alice offers first audio stream with three codecs and the other with
   [RFC2833] tones (for DTMF).  Bob accepts both the audio streams by
   choosing Opus as the audio codec and the telephone-event for the
   other stream.

   title Audio Session with DTMF
   participant Alice as Alice

   Alice->Bob: Offer(Audio:Opus,PCMU,PCMA Audio:telephone-event)
   Bob->Alice: Answer(Audio:Opus, Audio:telephone-event)
   Alice->Bob: Opus audio stream and telephone-event stream

                        Table 12: 5.2.6 SDP Answer

5.2.7.  Audio, Video Session with BUNDLE Support Unknown

   In this example, since Alice is unsure of the Bob's support of the
   BUNDLE framework, following 3 step procedures are performed in order
   to negotiate and setup a unique BUNDLE Address for the session
   o  An SDP Offer, in which the Alice assigns unique addresses to each
      "m=" line in the BUNDLE group, and requests the Answerer to select
      the Offerer's BUNDLE address.
   o  An SDP Answer, in which the Bob indicates its support for BUNDLE,
      and assigns its own BUNDLE address for the BUNDLED m= lines.
   o  A subsequent SDP Offer from Alice, which is used to perform a
      BUNDLE Address Synchronization (BAS).
   Once the Offer/Answer exchange completes, both Alice and Bob each end
   up using single RTP Session for both the Media Streams.

title 2-Way Secure Audio,Video with BUNDLE support unknown

Alice->Bob: Offer(Audio:Opus Video:VP8)
note right of Alice
Alice offers BUNDLE support with unique address for the audio and video m-line
end note

Bob->Alice: Answer(Audio:Opus Video:VP8) indicating its support for BUNDLE
note left of Bob
Bob uses identical addresses across the m=lines
end note

Alice->Bob: Updated Offer(Audio:Opus Video:VP8) for Bundle Address Synchronzation.

Alice <-> Bob: 2Way Call with Audio and Video Multiplexed

                        Table 17: 5.2.8 SDP Answer

5.2.9.  Secure Two-Way Audio,Video w/BUNDLE Unsupported

   This use-case illustrates SDP Offer/Answer exchange when the far-end
   (Bob) either doesn't support media bundling or doesn't want to group
   m=lines over a single 5-tuple.

   On successful Offer/Answer exchange, Alice and Bob each end up using
   unique 5-tuple for audio and video media streams respectively.

title 2-Way Secure Audio,Video with BUNDLE Unsupported

Alice->Bob: Offer(Audio:Opus Video:VP8)
note right of Alice
Alice offers BUNDLE support with unique address for the audio and video m-line
end note

Bob->Alice: Answer(Audio:Opus Video:VP8)
note left of Bob
Bob uses unique addresses as well since he doesn't understand BUNDLE
end note

Alice <-> Bob: 2Way Call with Audio and Video on different addresses.

5.3.  MultiResolution, RTX, FEC Examples

   This section deals with scenarios related to multiresolution
   negotiation such as layered coding, simulcast, along with techniques
   that deal with providing robustness against transmission errors such
   as FEC and RTX.  Also to note, meachnisms such as FEC and RTX could
   be envisioned in the above basic scenarios as well.

5.3.1.  Sendonly Simulcast w/2 cameras and 2 encodings per camera

   This SDP below shows Offer/Answer exchange with an audio and two
   video streams each of which can be sent at two different resolutions.

   One video stream supports VP8, while the other supports H.264.

   bundle-only framework is used along with BUNDLE grouping framework to
   enable multiplexing of all the 5 streams (1 audio stream + 4 video
   streams) over a single RTP Session.

title 1 Way Successful Simulcast w/BUNDLE

note right of Alice
Alice offers 2 sendonly video streams with 2 simulcast encodings per stream
end note
Alice->Bob: Offer(Audio:Opus,Video1:VP8,Video2:H.264) with bundle-only for video
note left of Bob
Bob accepts Alice's offer and 2 encodings per stream
end note
Alice->Bob: One-Way 1 Opus, 2 H.264 and 2 VP8 video streams, all mulitplexed

5.3.4.  Successful 1-way Simulcast with 2 resolutions and RTX - One
        resolution rejected

   This section shows an SDP Offer/Answer exchange for a simulcast
   scenario with 2 two resolutions and has [RFC4588] style re-
   transmission flows.

   It also showcases when Bob rejects one of the Simulcast Video Stream
   which results in the rejection of the associated repair stream
   implicitly

                  Table 33: 5.3.4 SDP Answer no Simulcast

5.3.5.  Simulcast Video Stream with Forward Error Correction

   This section shows an SDP Offer/Answer exchange for Simulcast video
   stream at two resolutions and and has [RFC5956] style FEC flows.

   On completion of Offer/Answer exchange we end up one audio stream, 2
   simulcast video streams and 2 associated FEC streams are sent over a
   single 5-tuple.

5.4.3.  Successful legacy Interop Fallaback with bundle-only

   In the scenario described below, Alice is a multi-stream capable
   WebRTC endpoint while Bob is a legacy VOIP end-point.  The SDP Offer/
   Answer exchange demonstrates successful session setup with fallback
   to audio only stream negotiated via bundle-only framework between the
   end-points.  Specifically,
   o  Offer from Alice describes 2 cameras via 2 video m=lines with both
      marked as bundle-only.
   o  Since Bob doesnot recognize either BUNDLE mechanism or bundle-only
      attribute, he accepts only the audio stream from Alice.

title Successful 2-Way WebRTC <-> VOIP Interop

note right of Alice
Alice is a multistream capable WebRTC end-point & Bob is behind a legacy VOIP system
end note
Alice->Bob: Offer(Audio:Opus Video: 2 VP8, 2 H2.64 Streams) with bundle-only offer
note right of Alice
Alice marks both the video streams as bundle-only
end note
Bob->Alice: Answer(Audio:Opus)
note left of Bob
 Bob accepts only Audio stream since he doesn't recognize
 bundle-only streams
end note
Alice<->Bob: Two-way Opus Audio

5.4.4.  Legacy Interop with RTP/AVP profile

   In this section, we attempt to provide session descriptions
   showcasing inter-operability between a WebRTC end-point and a Legacy
   VOIP end-point.  The ideas included in here are not fully baked into
   the standards and might be controversial in nature.  The hope here is
   to demonstrate a plausible SDP composition to enchance seamless
   inter-operability between the aforementioned communication systems.

   In the scenario desribed below, Alice sends [RFC3264] Offer with two
   sets of media descriptions per media type.
      One set that correponds to [WEBRTC] compliant UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF
      based audio and video descriptions.
      Another set with RTP/AVP based audio and video descriptions for
      the legacy Interop purposes.
      Also to note, Alice includes session level DTLS information and
      media level RTCP feedback information as applicable to both the
      sets of media descriptions

   On the other hand, Bob being a Legacy VOIP end-point, recognizes only
   the media descriptions with RTP/AVP as the application protocol.  The
   security and fedback requirements for the session are either handled
