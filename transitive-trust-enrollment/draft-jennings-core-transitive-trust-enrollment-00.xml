      <t>This document provides a very early sketch of a enrollment protocol
      that allows constrained internet devices to securely enroll into a
      system. As the work is in its early phase, many details remain to be
      resolved. The solution is based on the idea that each device will be
      manufactured with a one time password that can be used by the customer
      to tell the device which controller to enroll with.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Secure enrollment of devices into internet-based systems has never
      been easy. The constrained devices that need to be enrolled into systems
      today face many challenges. Typically, simple devices have no user
      interface such as a keyboard or screen - they may have only a single
      button or LED. At the time they are installed, there may not be a
      working network or even power. However, these devices are being used for
      applications that are increasingly important and safety-critical, so
      they need to have reasonable security and privacy characteristics. This
      documents specifies an enrollment system for such devices.</t>

      <t>In many systems, there is a need to configured a Device, such as a
      sensor or actuator, so that it is controlled by some specific
      controller. In the case Devices like a switch and light, it may be that
      all the Controller does is later configure the switch to control the
      light. To make this happen, both Devices need to be under the control of
      a common Controller that is authorized to make changes to the
      Devices.</t>

      <t>The simplified high-level information flow is illustrated in the
      following figure. The goal is to get to the point where the Device knows
      that it should be talking to the Controller.</t>

      <t>When the Manufacturer builds the Device, it includes a One Time
      Password (OTP) that the Introducer can use to enroll the Device with the
      Controller. The Manufacturer also runs a website known as the MotherShip
      that knows the OTP for every device that Manufacturer builds. The Device
      can include the OTP as a QR code on the outside of the Device. When the
      Device is installed, the installer uses a software agent known as the
      Introducer. The Introducer would typically be something like an
      application running on an iPhone. When the Device is installed, the
      Introducer can scan the QR code on the Device to find the OTP (Message
      1). The Introducer then contacts the MotherShip and uses the OTP to tell
      the MotherShip which Controller this Device is should use (Message 3).
      Later, the first time the Device boots up and gets network connectivity,
      it contacts the MotherShip, and the MotherShip tells the Device which
      Controller to talk to (Message 3). From that point on, any time the
      Device boots, the Device can communicate directly with the Controller
      (Message 4). The actual message flow is slightly more complicated and
      shown in <xref target="sec-enrollment"></xref>, but it uses the same
      basic idea as this simplified flow.</t>

      <t>The system is designed to achieve several desirable properties:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Can work for Devices with very limited memory and processing
          power</t>

          <t>Does not require network or power to be up when the Device is
          installed</t>

          <t>Is fairly secure (see more in the security section)</t>

          <t>Minimal addition to manufacturing costs</t>

          <t>The installer can detect if the OTP has already been used</t>

          <t>Provides a work flow in which a Device does not need to be taken
          out of the box to be enrolled. This can be very important to enable
          consumers themselves to enroll devices they buy from a service
          provider.</t>

          <t>Works with common Firewall and NAT network topologies</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>One of the key steps in making this system work is getting the OTP
      from the Device to Introducer. There are several ways that could happen
      but a few of the approaches considered here are:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Using a QR code or other bar code printed on the Device and/or
          box it comes in</t>

          <t>Having a single LED on the Device that blinks out the OTP
          information and using a video capture application on the Introducer
          to read this</t>

          <t>The manufacture providing the OTP in some other machine readable
          form</t>

          <t>Including the OTP in an RFID tag on the Device that can be read
          by the Introducer</t>

          <t>Having an electrical interface (such as one wire memory) on the
          Device that can be read by the Introducer</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The semantic level information in each message is discussed in <xref
      target="sec-enrollment"></xref> and the syntax of the messages is
      discussed in <xref target="sec-syntax"></xref>. The security properties
      of the system are described in <xref target="sec-sec"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-enrollment" title="Enrollment Information Flow">
      <t>The Manufacturer, Device, MotherShip, Introducer, and Controller are
      abbreviated M,D,MS,I,C respectively. The Device, MotherShip, and
      Controller all use CoAP to communicate with each other and thus each
      have an asymmetric key pair that is used to form the DTLS connections
      between them. The MotherShip acts as an HTTP server to communicate with
      the Introducer and Controller. The MotherShip needs a normal certificate
      to use HTTPS.</t>

      <t>It is assumed that the Device may have a NAT between it and the
      Controller and that the Device is on the inside of the NAT. The
      MotherShip is assumed to be a generally accessible server on the
      internet but the Controller and Device can be on the inside of a
      Firewall or NAT between them and the MotherShip.</t>

      <t>In the following message flow we use the following definitions:<list
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Fingerprint">This refers to a hash of the DTLS public
          key used by the associated network element. "MS Fingerprint" means a
          fingerprint of the public key that the MotherShip will use when
          forming CoAP connections over DTLS.</t>

          <t hangText="MS ID">A 32-bit integer that uniquely identifies the
          MotherShip. <xref target="sec-msid"></xref> explains how to use the
          MS ID to create a URL that can be used to contact the
          MotherShip.</t>

          <t hangText="Dev ID">A 32-bit integer that identifies the Device and
          when combined with the MotherShip is unique. Two Devices that use
          the same MotherShip cannot have the same Dev ID.</t>

          <t hangText="Dev URN">A globally unique URN assigned by the
          Manufacturer to uniquely identify this Device. This SHOULD be one of
          the URNs from <xref target="I-D.arkko-core-dev-urn"></xref>.</t>

          <t hangText="OTP">The One Time Password created by the Manufacturer
          for enrolling the Device. This is a cryptographically random 64-bit
          integer.</t>

          <t hangText="C Addr">Address of the Controller. This is an IPv4 or
          IPv6 address and port which the Device can use to form a CoAP
          connection to the Controller.</t>

          <t hangText="Dev Descp">A locally significant string that the
          Introducer can assign to a Device. For example, the convention for a
          thermostat in building 30, floor2, office 361 might be assign the
          string "BLD30/2/361 - Thermostat". This string is provided purely as
          a way to let the Introducer and Controller exchange information that
          may be useful for the Installer.</t>

          <t hangText="Dev Status">The Controller can query the MotherShip for
          the enrollment status of a Device that is enrolled with that
          Controller. The various states returned are defined in <xref
          target="sec-enroll-state"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The information flow is illustrated in the following figure. The goal
      is get to the point where the Device knows that it should be talking to
      the Controller, the Controller knows it should be talking the Device,
      and the Device and Controller can communicate using CoAP and
      authenticate each other using their public keys.</t>

      <t>When the Manufacturer builds the Device, it includes a One Time
      Password (OTP) on the Device and MotherShip (Message 1 and 2). When the
      Device is installed, the Introducer reads OTP and other information from
      the Device (Message 3). The Introducer then uses the OTP to tell the
      MotherShip which Controller this Device should use (Message 4 and 5).
      Later the Device contacts the MotherShip and tells the Device which
      Controller to talk to, information that the Device saves in non-volatile
      memory (Message 9 and 10). From that point on, any time the Device
      boots, it can directly communicate with the Controller (Message 11 and
      12).</t>

      <t>The Introducer has the option of informing Controller about any
      Devices that it has enrolled with this Controller (Message 6). The
      Controller can optionally contact the MotherShip to find out about the
      status of any Devices that it has not heard from (Messages 7 and 8).</t>

      <t>When the Device is built, it needs to be assigned a globally unique
      URN, a Dev ID, and a MotherShip. A single manufacturer MAY operate many
      MotherShips as each one can only support 16 million Devices. A perfectly
      reasonable way to generate the Dev ID is to use the least significant 32
      bits of the Device URN. The Device needs to be programmed with the IP
      address and port of the MotherShip along with the fingerprint of the
      public key that the MotherShip will use in the DTLS CoAP exchange.</t>

      <!--      <t>TODO ref RFC 5785 well known</t> -->

      <t>The creation of the MotherShip domain name is discussed in <xref
      target="sec-msid"></xref>. The QR code for the Device MUST be an HTTPS
      URL that points at the appropriate MotherShip and MUST include a URL
      parameter called "otp" that is set to OTP represented in hexadecimal and
      MUST include a URL parameter called "devid" that is set to the Device ID
      represented in hexadecimal. It MUST use the default HTTP port and MUST
      have an absolute path of /.well-known/tte. As an example, if the
      MotherShip's domain name was ""tte-000000.net", the OTP was
      0x123456789abcdef0 and the Device ID was 0xABCDEF01, a valid URL would
      be:</t>

        <artwork><![CDATA[

https://tte-000000.net/.well-known/tte?
        otp=123456789abcdef0,DevID=abcdef01]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The QR code SHOULD use an error coding level of "H". This would
      generate the following QR code:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork alt="Go Read the TXT version of this draft" src="qrcode.png"><![CDATA[
QR code in ASCII art left as an exercise 
to the reader but there is one in the PDF version.      ]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The Introducer reads the QR code found and the Device, then uses this
      URL to contact the MotherShip in messages 4 and 5. This URL is referred
      to as the Enrollment URL .</t>

      <t>Messages 4 and 5 MUST be sent over TLS, and the Introducer MUST
      verify that the HTTPS certificate of the MotherShip matches the URL. The
      Introducer can perform either an HTTPS GET or POST. If the Introducer
      does a GET, it MUST make an HTTPS GET request to the Enrollment URL and
      MUST act as a web browser to process returned HTML pages. In the case of
      a GET, the MotherShip MUST return a web page that allows the user to
      enter the IP address and port of the Controller as well as the
      fingerprint of the Controller's public key used in CoAP. If the
      Controller does not wish to act as a web browser, instead of using the
      GET, it will use a PUT. When using a PUT, the Controller MUST make an
      HTTPS POST request to a URL formed by appending three parameters to the
      Enrollment URL. The parameters are cip, which MUST have the IP address
      of the Controller; cport, which MUST have the port of the Controller;
      and cfingerprint, which MUST have the fingerprint of the Controller's
      Public Key, represented in hexadecimal. If, and only if, the MotherShip
      successfully stores the address information, the POST MUST return an
      HTTP 200 response with a JSON string containing the URN and Fingerprint
      for that Device. The format of this object is described in <xref
      target="sec-enroll-state"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Once the MotherShip has successfully stored the Controller's address
      for a given OTP, it MUST NOT allow that OTP to be used again to store an
      address for that Device. The OTP can be used after this to query the
      status of the enrollment as described in <xref
      target="sec-enroll-state"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Message 6 is optional and MAY be omitted. As some point after the
      Introducer has successfully mapped the Device to the Controller, it can
      send an HTTP or HTTPS request to the Controller to notify it that it can
      expect to hear from a particular Device. The message formats for this
      are defined in <xref target="sec-controller-enroll"></xref>. This does
      not need happen immediately and the information can be saved so it can
      be done far in the future. This might happen if Devices were being
      installed before the Controller was even operational. In other cases it
      might be done immediately. (TODO - look at in web browser case having
      MotherShip redirect Introducer to Controller after successful
      Introduction.) This is done with an HTTP POST to TBD URL with parameters
      to convey the Device URN and Fingerprint learned from the MotherShip,
      the OTP password, and a locally significant description string that can
      be used to help label the Device for management reasons.</t>

      <t>In the case where the Controller has learned the URN and OTP for a
      given Device, it MAY query the MotherShip to find out the enrollment
      status. It does this with an HTTP GET request to TBD URL. The various
      statuses that can be returned in TBD JSON doc are: revoked, not mapped,
      mapped, registered. TODO - could use better names and descriptions.</t>

      <t>When the Device has powered up and has network connectivity for the
      first time, it attempts to form a CoAP connection to the MotherShip. The
      Device makes a CoAP GET request to TBD URL, passing its URN as a
      parameter. Details of this message are provided in <xref
      target="sec-coap-enroll"></xref>. The Device MUST check that the Public
      Key provided by the MotherShip in the DTLS connection matches the
      fingerprint provided by the Manufacturer. The MotherShip needs to look
      at the Public Key provided in the DTLS and ensure that it matches the
      fingerprint for this Device that was provided by the Manufacturer. If
      everything does match, the MotherShip MUST return (in Message 10) the IP
      address and port for the Controller as well as the Fingerprint for the
      Controller's public key. Details for the syntax of these messages are
      provided in <xref target="sec-coap-enroll"></xref>. If this is
      successful, the Device MUST store the address and fingerprint for the
      Controller in non-volatile memory and, on future reboots, skip all the
      steps before this and connect directly to the Controller. (TODO - Define
      how retries work if the Device has not yet been enrolled.)</t>

      <t>At this point, the Device can form a CoAP connection to the
      Controller. The Device can verify that it is speaking to the correct
      Controller by checking that the DTLS Public Key matches the fingerprint
      for the Controller that was retrieved from the MotherShip. If the
      Introducer has contacted the Controller in message 6, then the
      Controller will already have the fingerprint of the Device and can
      verify that it matches the DTLS information in the connection between
      the Device and the Controller.</t>

      <t>The Controller MAY be configured such that if it does not have the
      information from Message 6 it can ignore the Device until it gets the
      information from the Introducer, or, alternatively, such that it can
      accept the connection based purely on the fact that the network was
      configured to send messages to the Controller.</t>

        a MotherShip ID that has a high order byte of 0x00, the DNS host name
        of the MotherShip if formed by prepending "tte-" to the lower order 24

      <t>This section has not really been started and needs lots of work.</t>

      <t>TODO - Discuss how one can replace a dead Controller with a new one
      in an operational network. The short answer is likely that one needs to
      back up the private keys of the old Controller and move these to the new
      Controller.</t>

      <t>What happens if the OTP is stolen during Device transit? The short
      answer is that the Device is compromised at this point and needs to be
      discarded or returned to the manufacture to get a new Device ID and OTP.
      The Introducer needs to detect that this has happened and warn the
      user.</t>

      <t>There are additional concerns about Devices that may be operational
      without ever being introduced to a Controller. For example, if a light
      switch supported this protocol, but could also be used just as a stand
      alone light switch, there is a risk the OTP could be stolen by an
      attacker, with the attacker enrolling the Device to the attacker's
      Controller. When the correct user installs the light switch, if they
      never bother to try to Introduce it to anything, they will not detect
      that it has been compromised. One way to mitigate this risk in
      situations where it exists might be to include some manual configuration
      on the Device to indicate that it is to be used in stand-alone mode,
      such as a jumper that can be cut.</t>

      <t>Network topology consideration - Introducer can install firewall
      rules that allow Devices to contact MotherShip.</t>

    <section title="Variations">
      <section title="LED Based Enrollment">
        <t>An alternative to QR codes is to have an LED on the Device flash
        out the relevant information to the Introducer. The output string is
        formed by concatenating a 16-bit start of message constant value of
        0x0001, followed by the MotherShip ID, Device ID, OTP, and then an
        8-bit two's compliment checksum value computed over the previous
        bytes, including the start of message constant. All values are in
        network byte order. The resulting string is output using
        Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted (NRZI) encoding on the LED at a baud rate
        of 15 bps. This allows a Device such as a smartphone with video
        capture to detect the signal and recover the information.</t>

        <t>TODO - see if this works at 30 bps. See about encoding multiple
        intensity levels or colors in the LED. Initial experiments indicate
        this does not work very well as auto contrast in the video camera

        outside of a box and can bulk enroll all the sensors in the box.
        Perhaps have a scheme where there is a master secret and start and end
        Device ID on the outside of box bar code. Then the OTP for a given
        Device is generated using the master secret and DeviceID of that
        Device. Need to sort out details of a scheme like this.</t>

      <section title="No Public Key Crypto">
        <t>The examples here assumed that COAP was being used with DTLS with
        asymmetric keys. It would also be possible to use DTLS in Pre Shared
        Key (PSK) mode in a very similar flow, where the Introducer provided
        the MotherShip with the PSK to be used between the Device and the
        Controller.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol
            (CoAP), a specialized web transfer protocol for use with
            constrained networks and nodes for machine-to-machine applications
            such as smart energy and building automation. These constrained
            nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM
            and RAM, while networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet
            error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. CoAP
            provides a method/response interaction model between application
            end-points, supports built-in resource discovery, and includes key
            web concepts such as URIs and content-types. CoAP easily
            translates to HTTP for integration with the web while meeting
            specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low
            overhead and simplicity for constrained environments.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This memo describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
            for hardware device identifiers. A general representation of
            device identity can be useful in many applications, such as in
            sensor data streams and storage, or equipment inventories. A
            URN-based representation can be easily passed along in any
            application that needs the information.</t>
